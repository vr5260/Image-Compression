# Image-Compression
This project shows how we can compress images without losing any quality by using the Huffman Coding algorithm. It works by giving shorter binary codes to the pixel values that appear more often, which helps in reducing the overall file size.

The main logic is done using Python, and there's a basic web interface made with HTML to make it easier for users to try out the compression and see how it works.
